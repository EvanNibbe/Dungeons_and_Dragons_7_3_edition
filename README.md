# Dungeons_and_Dragons_7_3_edition
This describes a rule system that has been gradually updated from an original PowerPoint which describes the directly playable spells. The further edition descriptions expand upon allowing the game to utilize real-world physics and High Magic spells that have no probability distribution for figuring them out. The most important spell players will likely strive for is the Ritual of the Myriad At War with the Weave. This spell allows you to cast Wish (otherwise prohibited from being cast by anyone other than a 17th level or higher Sorcerer who must be born from a line of Sorcerers which must start with a parent having learned the 10th level Necromancy spell Weapon of Undeath (often referred to as Sword of Undeath) to cast it and cut themselves with it. Transforming oneself with At War with the Weave (with the help of 1000s of other friends with the same dedication to learning High Magic as you and to giving you power at great personal cost to them) allows you to grant a level in Cleric to any willing person and exert your will using the equivalents of 3 non-directly-damaging spells on some component of reality everywhere in the Universe and within 150 feet of your clerics (who gain additional levels in Cleric according to their experience points as further specified in 7.1). The other options with this spell include such things as allowing the Weave to support an additional spell at a certain level, altering spells, and altering schools of Magic, but the personal cost to the 1000s of casters involved is always very high. This includes removing At War with the Weave from being able to be cast, but that requires more than 1,000,000 Ancient Gold Dragons worth of hp to die. Details must be sought after earnestly in order to be found. The more important spell as far as actually being able to learn a spell in less than 1145 years goes is Create Ring of Power. This is an 11th level spell in the School of Transmutation that basically allows for a Lord of the Rings campaign to be played with some realism. The nature of this spell would generally require that the (presumably BBEG who wants one) to be a patron of 100s of Wizards in the School of Transmutation in order to have enough people in the levels beneath himself to actually support his ability to learn the spell, and again in every other School of Magic in order to learn the spells to build into his Ring (such as the 11th level Divination spell See All Rings of Power, which must be cast into a Ring of Power at the same time as Create Ring of Power, and Control Rings of Power, the 11th level Enchantment spell that must be cast into a Ring of Power at the same time as Create Ring of Power. 
Be sure to understand that in spite of the fact that you can combine the level 1 spell slots you earn from the schools of magic
(equal to the level of the highest level spell you know from a given school of magic (or figured out by you from a scroll, which must have recursively been derived from someone learning it at one of the 8 schools of magic,
of which one of each only can exist at any time on all planes of existence) summed for all schools of magic) indefinitely, you can use them to create creatures of at most CR 9. Using High Magic, you can create creatures of at most CR 11.

Also note that in order to have true levels for the purpose of using transmutation spells like Shapechange, True Polymorph and Polymorph, you need to be specifically granted levels by either a Warlock patron, a CLeric patron (someone transformed by the High Magic Ritual of the Myriad "At War with the Weave"), or a Druid patron (someone transformed by the High Magic Ritual of the Myriad "At War with the Weave" who also may have made a mistake in terms of associating their soul with living things which are strictly mortal (discluded whenever altered to not be associated with that item, and not extending to that creature's offspring)). 
Otherwise you can transform into creatures of up to CR 9 using those spells if you have earned 20 years worth of levels in Schools of Magic or more. Turning into a Young Dragon is generally the way to gain additional temporary CR. 
Everyone who doesn't fit into the above two categories can only be turned into at most CR 1 creatures.

The Divine Intervention 10th level ability of Clerics, when it works (using the d100 table as in 5e), allows the patron access to comprehension (in the form of virtual intelligence like what happens with the 12th level Divination spell See All) to the extent that the patron can use two additional casts of Wish as if it were anywhere within 150 feet of that cleric per 6 seconds for 1 minute while holding concentration on up to a number of spells that require it equal to the number of cleric levels that cleric has. 
This happens all without interrupting anything else the patron is doing at that time. Planar Ally is just a spell which basically acts like a free transferrable teleport of one creature by the patron targeted. 
Alternatively, at a cost of one of their clerical levels (reducing the maximum number of clerical levels they can earn permanently by 1 as well (on a successful use of divine intervention), the cleric can ask for and recieve a request for power that would be nearly impossible to figure out by other means (using intervention in this way means using it in a way that does not have an equivalent performance in any other spell). Such intervention may include turning the cleric into a lich (with the cleric's own list of preparable spells and maximum number of prepared spells preserved, along with not needing to consume souls to maintain one's appearance, similar to that High Magic Ritual of Solitude which, by construction, is hard to figure out), or in creating creatures with a CR below the cleric's level in Cleric that do not exist in the sources otherwise allowed.
